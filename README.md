*Interface showing network adapters, DNS server options, and current DNS settings*

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Administrator privileges (the application will request elevation automatically)

## Installation

### Option 1: Run from Source

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dns-changer.git
   cd dns-changer
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install customtkinter
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python dns_changer.py
   ```

### Option 2: Standalone Executable

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/dns-changer/releases) page
2. Extract the files to a folder
3. Run `dns_changer.exe`

## Usage

### First Launch
1. The application will automatically request administrator privileges
2. Network interfaces will be loaded and displayed on the left panel
3. A default `dns_list.txt` file will be created with common DNS servers

### Changing DNS Settings
1. **Select Interface(s)**: Check one or more network interfaces from the left panel
2. **View Current Settings**: Selected interfaces' current DNS settings appear in the middle panel
3. **Choose DNS Server**: Select a DNS server preset from the right panel
4. **Apply Changes**: Click "Apply Selected DNS" to update the settings

### Resetting to DHCP
1. Select the interface(s) you want to reset
2. Click "Set to Automatic (DHCP)" to revert to automatic DNS assignment

### Refreshing Interfaces
- Click "Refresh Interfaces" to reload the network adapter list
- Useful when connecting/disconnecting network devices

## DNS Server Configuration

The application reads DNS server presets from `dns_list.txt`. The format is:
```
# DNS Server List
# Format: Name,Primary DNS,Secondary DNS
Google DNS,8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
Cloudflare DNS,1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1
OpenDNS,208.67.222.222,208.67.220.220
Quad9,9.9.9.9,149.112.112.112
AdGuard DNS,94.140.14.14,94.140.15.15
```

### Adding Custom DNS Servers
1. Open `dns_list.txt` in any text editor
2. Add new entries following the format: `Name,Primary DNS,Secondary DNS`
3. Save the file and restart the application or use "Refresh Interfaces"

## Technical Details

### PowerShell Commands Used
The application uses the following PowerShell commands for DNS management:

- **List Network Adapters**: 
  ```powershell
  Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq 'Up' ... }
  ```

- **Set DNS Servers**:
  ```powershell
  Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex <ID> -ServerAddresses ("8.8.8.8","1.1.1.1")
  ```

- **Reset to DHCP**:
  ```powershell
  Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex <ID> -ResetServerAddresses
  ```

- **Get Current DNS**:
  ```powershell
  Get-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex <ID>
  ```

### Interface Filtering
The application filters network interfaces to show only:
- Interfaces with "Up" status
- Non-virtual interfaces (excludes VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V, etc.)
- Non-loopback interfaces
- Interfaces with valid media types

## Building from Source

To create a standalone executable:

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Build the executable**:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --icon="icona.ico" --noconsole --name DNSChanger --onefile --windowed --uac-admin --add-data "dns_list.txt;." dns_changer.py
   ```

3. **The executable will be created in the `dist` folder**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No active network adapters found"**
- Ensure you're running as administrator
- Check that your network adapters are connected and enabled
- Try clicking "Refresh Interfaces"

**"PowerShell Error"**
- Verify PowerShell is installed and accessible
- Check that execution policy allows script execution
- Ensure you have administrator privileges

**"Administrator rights are required"**
- Right-click the application and select "Run as administrator"
- The application should normally request elevation automatically

**DNS changes not taking effect**
- Some applications may cache DNS settings
- Try restarting your browser or flushing DNS cache: `ipconfig /flushdns`
- Restart the network adapter if necessary

### Logging and Debugging
The application provides real-time status updates in the bottom status bar. Error messages will appear in red, warnings in orange, and success messages in green.
